# How to Compile
This is a tutorial on how to compile

go to [Friday Night Funkin's Source Code](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions) to start...

Once your done, run these in a terminal
```
haxelib git flixel-leather https://github.com/Leather128/flixel.git
haxelib git scriptless-polymod https://github.com/SrtHero278/scriptless-polymod
haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/AndreiRudenko/linc_luajit
haxelib git hscript-improved https://www.github.com/YoshiCrafter29/hscript-improved
haxelib git openfl https://github.com/openfl/openfl
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
```

If you are running debug also run this too if you haven't!
```
haxelib install hxcpp-debug-server
```

Once you have done all of that run `lime test [platform name]` in the terminal
[platform name] is your platformm your running this on (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc)

Wait a bit then you're done!
